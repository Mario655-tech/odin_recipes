    <h1>Description</h1>
    <p>Spaghetti is a long, thin pasta that is a staple in Italian cuisine and enjoyed worldwide. Made from durum wheat semolina, spaghetti is typically boiled until al dente, meaning it is cooked just enough to retain a firm texture while being tender to the bite. Its elongated shape allows it to be easily twirled around a fork, making it a popular choice for various sauces and toppings. Spaghetti pairs well with a wide range of sauces, from simple marinara or carbonara to more complex meat or seafood-based sauces. Its versatility, quick cooking time, and delicious taste make spaghetti a favorite dish for both home cooks and chefs alike.</p>
